# Exploring-the-Bitcoin-Cryptocurrency-Market
To better understand the growth and impact of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, this project will explore the market capitalization of different cryptocurrencies.

Note: This is a DataCamp guided project. The dataset used by DataCamp is for 2017. 
Therefore, I scraped the 2022 dataset from coinmarketcap for this project to be more relevant.
